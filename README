*   Twitter groups in XSLT    *
*******************************

Just some XSL files to create a view on twitter with the tweets
grouped according to the user they came from. The configuration file
is in XML and should be in xml/groups.xml. It's format should be along
the lines of:

<groups>
  <group name="groupname">
    <user>username</user>
  </group>
</groups>

That is, one group entry per group and one user entry per user in
group. It expects an xml/current.xml file which follows the format
that twitter uses in its API.
